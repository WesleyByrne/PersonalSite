		<h1>Dream Big</h1>
		<p>Hello, my name is Wesley Byrne, and I am working towards a career in Computer Science. 
		I have a degree from Tennessee Tech University, and I have experience working in object oriented languages
		such as Java and C++. </p>
		<p>I work hard daily to explore new technologies and polish my programming as well as soft skills. I continue to find new languages to explore almost daily.
		I believe in a brighter future!</p>
